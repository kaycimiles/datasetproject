Data Analytics Fall 2021 Course Project


Motivation: The motivation for this project is to determine the top ten visited parks in the US during 2020. with Covid-19 more people were ready to go explore the outdoors after being locked up in our homes. 

Data Process: I started with my research at the National Park website - https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/visitation-numbers.htm On the website there is multiple tables including the top 10 most visited parks in the US. I took this data and created a excel spreadsheet with the table information found on the website.

Visualization: Please view visualization in my visualization file here in my project. I was unable to attach a image to this posting. The image is a bar graph of I created in Excel with the data by the millions of people who visited the top ten parks in the US.

Analysis: While doing the research for this project I ensured I was using a legitimate website with accurate raw data for me to present. With the raw data I took the excel skills I learned to creata a data table and convert it into a bar graph. I ensured the bar graph is clear and readable for it's viewers. I ensured I labebed the graph so if a viewer was to just look at my visualization they could see the point the data is trying to convey.
